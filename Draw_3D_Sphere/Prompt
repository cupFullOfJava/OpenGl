CSC 370: Programming Exercise #2
Basic 3D Rendering with Raycasting Algorithm

For this project you will need a graphics context to which you can draw pixels.
Your first project with image-buffer and drawPixel() functionality will work well.

Complete the following and upload by the due date:

1. Implement a basic ray-casting algorithm that includes ray-sphere intersections.
Create four spheres of different color that are visible within your camera.
Complete an orthographic and a perspective render that includes at least
portions of all four spheres. Write your images to two .sif files.

2. Implement Blinn shading and use with at least one point light to add basic
shading to your scene from above. Complete both an orthographic and
perspective render. Write your images to two .sif files.

3. Submit your renders bundled together in a .tgz or .zip file named
   370LastnameFirstname.tgz.
